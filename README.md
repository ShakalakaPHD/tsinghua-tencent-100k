# Tsinghua-Tencent 100K

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

Tsinghua-Tencent 100K is a benchmark for traffic-sign detection and classification. It provides 100,000 images containing 30,000 traffic-sign instances.
It is focused on small object detection in real world. According to the paper, it said "A typical traffic-sign might be say 80 × 80 pixels, in a 2000 × 2000 pixel image, or just 0.2% of the image.".
It means that the small objects such as traffic-sign occupy the very small proportion in input image.

This benchmark is built by Caffe and installed in Ubuntu 14.04.  
I summarized how to setup this benchmark and learning/testing the CNN model which is proposed from this paper. I also added some codes for my experiment.

You need to check the compute capability version to install correct CUDA SDK version.  
Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs and find correct CUDA SDK version.  

In my case, I should install CUDA SDK 8.0 version. [CUDA compute capabilities >= 6.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs)

```

Next, please build Caffe and pycaffe.  

```bash
cd code/script
./compile.sh
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook
- To evaluate the test result, we need to use Jupyter Notebook.
- Please install Jupiter Notebook according to guide [Installing the Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)  
- This benchmark is based on Python 2.7.x and we have to install it as follows.  

If you have Python 2 installed:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```

## Data Preparation
- To download the TT100K dataset, please download the TT100K dataset and decompress the zip file.  
- Please convert 7z file and decompress again if you face an error when decompressing it. I tried to do this using with 7z in Windows.  


```bash
cd TT100k
wget http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/data_model_code/data.zip
unzip data.zip
```

- To train the dataset, we need to convert the dataset to LMDB format and calculate the image mean.  

```bash
mkdir -p ../../data/lmdb
./prepare.sh
```

## Training and Evaluation
### Training  
After doing data preparation, we can start the training process.  

```bash
cd code/script
./train.sh
```

The train.sh shell file is described as follows. You can also get the training log file.

```bash
../caffe/build/tools/caffe train --solver ../model/solver.prototxt --gpu 0 2>&1 | tee tt100k_training_01.log
```

### Evaluation  
- Before evaluation, you need to install Jupyter Notebook.  
- You need to install python dependencies such as opencv, matplotlib to evaluate the test result.  
- Please install correct dependencies if you see some errors when running python code on Jupyter Notebook.  

```bash
sudo pip install opencv-python
sudo pip install matplotlib
...
```
